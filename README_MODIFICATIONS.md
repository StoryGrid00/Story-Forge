# StoryForge - Modified Version

## What's New

This modified version of StoryForge includes significant improvements to the **World Building** section, making it more intuitive and powerful for writers to develop their story worlds.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Cleaner Interface
The duplicate "World Building" header has been removed from the top of the page, providing a cleaner, more professional look.
